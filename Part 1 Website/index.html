<h2>In this website, you'll learn about my favorite hobby - playing piano</h2>
<p>
    I've learned piano for 9 years from 9 to 17 years old, in which I stopped going to the piano class in my last
    year in high school. It's not because I don't like it anymore, it's just because the workload became more heavy and 
    I was busy with university applications. I certainly still love piano a lot and I continued learning it by myself 
    by doing self practice in my free time, where I picked the songs I like and played them using online piano sheets. 
    As I was one of a few people in my class who knows how to play piano, I often got asked or invited to play the 
    keyboard for school events, including the foreign language singing contest and my middle school and high school 
    graduation ceremonies. I enjoy playing in a band or friend group for school events, as I can showcase my skill to
    our school's crowd, although I always got really nervous before the show. In the following website, you can look at
    some piano songs I've played in the past with screenshots of my recordings and link to the ful video, which are mainly 
    J-pop or Chinese songs. My next goal is to play a piece called "Track in time" by Dennis Kuo, and the detail info about 
    that song can be accessed by clicking the button at the end of its description, which should take you to another page.

            This cover is about a piano duel clip from an old movie called Secret, which is an alternation piece from  
            Chopin's Waltz. The cover is short but really hard to play as the pace is fast and the right hand arrangement
            is pretty complex with a lot of jumps between two octaves. I played this piece on 2021/12/30.

            This cover is a Japanese song by Yoasobi, I first listened to this song randomly on Youtube, then quickly fell
            in love with it. The melody is beautiful and the lyrics and MV story behind the song are also great. The cover 
            is not as hard as the first one, but still took me a month to master it. I played this piece on 2022/04/01.

            This cover is the theme song of the movie Secret, which is composed from multiple old classic piano pieces.
            I first heard it from the movie clips, then from the piano covers on Youtube, which is so beautiful and I love
            the melody so much. This is perhaps, by far, the hardest piece I've ever played, and I'm proud that I managed
            to master it. I played this piece on 2022/06/25.

            My next goal in piano cover is to play this piece called Track in time by Dennis Kuo, which is a relaxing and
            chilling song. The notes arrangement is pretty easy with no fancy fingering or glissando, but the melody is
            heavenly and beautiful, which is why I've decided to do its cover next. I wish I can complete it by this summer
            when I get back home.
